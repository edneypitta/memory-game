Hi, this is my code for letgo technical test!

## Notes

* Next.js was used for Server Side Rendering and Code Splitting
* Characters are being loaded from Rick and Morty API
* Enzyme was used along with Jest for testing

## Running the app

* Run `yarn install` and then `yarn start` to boot the app at port 8080
* To run tests, run `yarn test`

## Opportunities to improve

If I were to invest more time on the assignment, these are the next things that I would work on:

* Prop types for React components
* Error handling on Redux actions
* More tests for pages
* Polish UI and add features (counter, reset, etc.)

Thanks!
